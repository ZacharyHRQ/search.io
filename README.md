# Search.io
The application is a little search engine implemented in Trie Data Structure. The key feature of the application is to provide recommendations to auto-complete the query when the user types in a prefix of his query. The user can also retrieve the definition when he searches for a keyword which exists in the search engineâ€™s dictionary. Other than that, the application demonstrates different types of searching algorithms which are KMP and naive searching.
